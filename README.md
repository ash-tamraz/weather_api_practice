# Weather API Pracitice

A little project to practice working with APIs, based on a suggestion
by [Elliot Berry](https://github.com/elliotberry). 

The goal is to take latitude and longitude coordinates from the user, and 
return weather data for that area. The API I'm using to retrieve this data 
is [the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) Climate Data 
Online (CDO) Web Services.](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/webservices/v2)

Currently I will be focusing on precipitation data, but that may change as
I make progress.
